				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Welcome to Dont Verify Me. This Privacy Policy explains our approach
					to your privacy, which is simple: we believe the best way to protect
					your privacy is to not collect your data in the first place.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Unlike most websites, we have designed our platform to operate without
					requiring any personal information from you. We don't have user
					accounts, we don't use cookies, and we don't employ any tracking
					mechanisms.
				</p>

					2. Information We Don't Collect
				</h2>

				<h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">
					2.1 No Personal Information
				</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We do not collect, store, or process any personal information
					including but not limited to:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>Names, email addresses, or phone numbers</li>
					<li>IP addresses or device identifiers</li>
					<li>Location data or geolocation information</li>
					<li>Browsing history or usage patterns</li>
					<li>Account credentials (we don't have user accounts)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">2.2 No Cookies or Tracking</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We do not use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or any other tracking
					technologies. Your visit to our website leaves no digital footprint on
					our servers.
				</p>

				<h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">2.3 No Analytics</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We do not use Google Analytics, Hotjar, or any other analytics
					services that would track your behavior or collect data about your
					visit.
				</p>

				<h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">
					2.4 No Public User Accounts
				</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Our website does not require or support user registration or login for
					public visitors. You can access all information without creating an
					account, which means we never ask for or store usernames, passwords,
					or any authentication credentials from visitors.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					3. Administrative Access
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We maintain a limited number of administrative accounts for internal
					content management and website maintenance purposes only. These
					accounts are:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>Not available to the public</li>
					<li>Used exclusively by our team for managing website content</li>
					<li>
						Protected with authentication cookies necessary for secure admin
						sessions
					</li>
					<li>Subject to strict access controls and security measures</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mb-4">
					<strong>Important:</strong> Administrative authentication does not
					affect public visitors. When you browse our website as a regular
					visitor, no cookies are set and no tracking occurs. Authentication
					cookies are only used by administrators when logged into the content
					management system, and this data is never associated with public
					visitors.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					4. How Our Website Works
				</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Our website operates as a public informational resource. When you
					visit our site as a regular visitor:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>Your browser requests pages from our server</li>
					<li>The server delivers the requested content</li>
					<li>No logs are kept of your visit</li>
					<li>No cookies are set in your browser</li>
					<li>No data about you is stored or processed</li>
					<li>
						Your session ends when you close your browser with no trace left
						behind
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We do not integrate any third-party services that would collect your
					data. This includes:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>No social media plugins or widgets</li>
					<li>No advertising networks</li>
					<li>No content delivery networks that track users</li>
					<li>No external analytics or monitoring tools</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mb-4">
					All resources needed to display our website are served directly from
					our servers.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					<strong>Note:</strong> Our administrative system uses Supabase for
					secure authentication of internal team members only. This
					authentication service does not interact with or collect any data from
					public visitors.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Server Logs</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Our web server does not maintain access logs for public visitors.
					Standard server logging is disabled, meaning we do not record:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>IP addresses of visitors</li>
					<li>Requested URLs or pages</li>
					<li>Browser or device information</li>
					<li>Timestamps of visits</li>
					<li>Referrer information</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Data Security</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Since we don't collect or store any of your data as a public visitor,
					there is no personal information that could be compromised in the
					event of a security breach. The best data security is having no data
					to secure.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					However, we still maintain industry-standard security practices for
					our website infrastructure, including:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>HTTPS encryption for all connections</li>
					<li>Regular security updates and patches</li>
					<li>Secure server configurations</li>
					<li>Multi-factor authentication for administrative access</li>
					<li>Encrypted storage for administrative credentials</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">8. Your Rights</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Under various privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), you have rights
					regarding your personal data. However, since we don't collect any
					personal information from public visitors:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Access:</strong> Not applicable - we have no data
						about you to access
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> Not applicable - we have no
						data to correct
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> Not applicable - we have no data
						to delete
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Not applicable - we have
						no data to export
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Object:</strong> Not applicable - we don't process
						your data
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mb-4">
					By design, your privacy rights are automatically respected because we
					simply don't have your data.

				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Children's Privacy</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">

					personal information from anyone, including children under 13, there
					are no special concerns regarding children's privacy.

				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">12. Legal Compliance</h2>
				<p className="mb-4">

					(EU), CCPA (California), and other privacy regulations. Our
					zero-data-collection approach for public visitors ensures compliance
					by default.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					In the unlikely event we receive a legal request for public visitor
					data, we would have nothing to provide.
